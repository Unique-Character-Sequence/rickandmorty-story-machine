## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/pPhvhk6.png)

The Rick and Morty Story Machine allows you to create your own unique DnD-like, Rick and Morty-inspired stories. Choose a randomized character or create your own, select some inventory items, and then make choices based on your character's stats or items to solve various situations. In the end, you will receive one possible ending for your story. Get creative and enter the world of Rick and Morty with the Story Machine!

## Roadmap

DnD-inspired character creation: Users will create a character by selecting a race, class, and attributes such as strength, dexterity, intelligence, and charisma. These attributes will affect the story later on.

Inventory selection screen: After creating a character, users will be prompted to choose some starting items to add to their inventory.

Dice rolls for decisions: When the user is presented with a situation, they can roll a virtual die to determine which choice they make. For example, if the user needs to choose between fighting or negotiating with an alien, they can roll a die to determine their approach.

Randomized events: During the story, random events could occur based on the user's character and inventory items. For example, a user with a laser gun in their inventory might encounter a group of hostile robots, or a user with a high intelligence attribute might discover a hidden laboratory.

Story generation: Once the user has created their character and selected their inventory items, the story will be generated using pre-made stories. The user will be presented with various situations where they can make choices based on their character's attributes or inventory items.

Combat system: For situations where the user needs to engage in combat, a simple turn-based combat system could be implemented. Users could roll a virtual die to determine their attack, and their opponent could roll a die to determine their defense.

Quests and rewards: Users could be given quests to complete during the story, and upon completion, they could earn rewards such as new inventory items or attribute increases.

Unlockable content: As the user progresses through the game, they could unlock new characters, items, and story options.

Achievements: The user could earn achievements for completing certain tasks or making certain decisions during the story.

Alternate endings: Depending on the user's choices throughout the story, they could unlock different endings. This would encourage the user to replay the game.
